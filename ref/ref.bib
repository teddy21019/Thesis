abstract = {We study the exchange economies of Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) in which agents must use a commodity or fiat money as a medium of exchange if trade is to occur. Our agents are artificially intelligent and are modeled as using classifier systems to make decisions. In the assignment of credit within the classifier systems, we introduce some innovations designed to study sequential decision problems in a multi-agent environment. For most economies that we have simulated, trading and consumption patterns converge to a stationary Nash equilibrium even if agents start with random rules. In economies with multiple equilibria, the only equilibrium that emerges in our simulations is the one in which goods with low storage costs play the role of medium of exchange (i.e., the ‘fundamental equilibrium’ of Kiyotaki and Wright).}

 abstract = {Adverse shocks to the economy may be amplified by worsening credit-market conditions--the "financial accelerator." Theoretically, we interpret the financial accelerator as resulting from endogenous changes over the business cycle in the agency costs of lending. An implication of the theory is that, at the onset of a recession, borrowers facing high agency costs should receive a relatively lower share of credit extended (the flight to quality) and hence should account for a proportionally greater part of the decline in economic activity. We review the evidence for these predictions and present new evidence drawn from a panel of large and small manufacturing firms.},

 abstract = {The goal of this paper is to extend existing search-theoretic models of fiat money, which until now have assumed that the price level is exogenous, by explicitly incorporating bilateral bargaining. This allows us to determine the price level endogenously and leads to additional insights concerning the role of money. For example, we find that monetary equilibria are generally inefficient in the sense that output and prices differ from the solution to a social planner's problem, although the difference can become small as the discount rate or search friction vanishes. We also find that there exist nonstationary inflationary equilibria.},

The basic model is a cash-in-advance economy which is a simplified version of Lagos and Wright's (2005) model. We introduce the banks using Diamond and Rajan (2001) in this economy: Bankers can produce goods more efficiently than depositors but cannot pre-commit to the use of human capital on behalf of the latter. Demand deposit contracts work as a commitment device for bankers, while leaving banks susceptible to bank runs. We show that as the inflation rate increases, the size of the banking sector expands, and the probability of bank runs occurring rises.},
