This paper considers the risk on bank run as cross-border central bank digital
currency (CBDC) enters an emerging country. Bank run is a main consideration on
the literatures of CBDC, as interest bearing CBDC might compete with demand
deposits offered by commercial bank. Means can be legislated to prevent the
risk, but cross-border CBDC, especially that coming from a highly developed
country, which is overwhelmingly popular as a global means of payment, might be
difficult to regulate as the technology of CBDC is digitalized, hence
exacerbating the emergence of a bank run. In this paper, an agent-based model is
used to approach this issue to simulate the dynamic currency substitution episode,
as well as the emergence of a bank run episode.
